Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, facilitating visualization of the data in both 2D and 3D to derive insightful patterns.

Compared the accuracy and running times of different Machine Learning models trained on both PCA and Non-PCA dataset.

Demonstrated that quality of data is more important than the quality of the model.
